## Self Hosted Runners on Managed Instance Group

This module handles the opinionated creation of infrastructure necessary to deploy Github Self Hosted Runners on MIG Container VMs.

This includes:

- Enabling necessary APIs
- VPC
- NAT & Cloud Router
- MIG Container Instance Template
- MIG Instance Manager
- FW Rules

Below are some examples:

### [Self Hosted runners that support Docker Workflows](../../examples/gh-runner-mig-container-vm-dind/README.md)

This example shows how to deploy a Self Hosted Runner that supports Docker Workflows on MIG Container VMs.

### [Simple Self Hosted Runner](../../examples/gh-runner-mig-container-vm-simple/README.md)

This example shows how to deploy a Self Hosted Runner on MIG Container VMs.
