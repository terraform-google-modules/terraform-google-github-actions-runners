# Self Hosted Runners on GKE

This module handles the opinionated creation of infrastructure necessary to deploy GitHub Actions Runners on GKE. This module follows the guide provided by GitHub for [Quickstart for Actions Runner Controller](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/hosting-your-own-runners/managing-self-hosted-runners-with-actions-runner-controller/quickstart-for-actions-runner-controller).

This includes:

- Enabling necessary APIs
- VPC
- GKE Cluster
- Kubernetes Secret
- Installation via Helm Chart

## Usage
See below for example usage of this module:
```tf
module "runner-gke" {
  source  = "terraform-google-modules/github-actions-runners/google//modules/gh-runner-gke"
  version = "~> 4.0"

  project_id             = "PROJECT_ID"
  create_network         = true
  cluster_suffix         = "k8s"
  gh_app_id              = "123456"
  gh_app_installation_id = "12345678"
  gh_app_private_key     = "sample"
  gh_config_url          = "https://github.com/ORGANIZATION"
}
```

### Authenticating to GitHub

It's recommended to authenticate to GitHub via a GitHub App. Follow the instructions at [Authenticating ARC with a GitHub App](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/hosting-your-own-runners/managing-self-hosted-runners-with-actions-runner-controller/authenticating-to-the-github-api#authenticating-arc-with-a-github-app) to retrieve the necessary prerequisites:

- GitHub App ID
- GitHub App Installation ID
- GitHub App Private Key

Install the app in the organization or account for which the runners should be available.

Substitute these values gathered from creating the GitHub App installation into the variables in the module.

## Requirements

Before this module can be used on a project, you must ensure that the following pre-requisites are fulfilled:

1. Required APIs are activated

    ```
    "cloudresourcemanager.googleapis.com",
    "storage-api.googleapis.com",
    "iam.googleapis.com",
    "container.googleapis.com",
    "serviceusage.googleapis.com"
    ```

## Examples
