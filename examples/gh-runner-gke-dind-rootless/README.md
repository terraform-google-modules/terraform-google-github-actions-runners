# Self Hosted runners on GKE that support Docker Workflows

## Overview

This example shows how to deploy runners that support Docker Workflows on GKE.

More examples of [Self Hosted Runners on GKE/Anthos](https://github.com/github-developer/self-hosted-runners-anthos).

## Steps to deploy this example

- Step 1: Create terraform.tfvars file with the necessary values.

Access tokens require repo scope for private repos and public_repo scope for public repos. GitHub Apps must have the administration permission to use this API. Authenticated users must have admin access to the repository to use this API.

More info can be found [here](https://developer.github.com/v3/actions/self_hosted_runners/).

```tf
project_id = "your-project-id"
gh_token   = "your-github-token"
repo_url   = "https://github.com/owner/your-repo-name"
repo_name  = "your-repo-name"
repo_owner = "owner"
```

- Step 2: Create the infrastructure.

```sh
$ terraform init
$ terraform plan
$ terraform apply
```

- Step 3: Build the example runner image using Google Cloud Build. Alternatively, you can also use a prebuilt image or build using a local docker daemon.

```sh
$ gcloud config set project $PROJECT_ID
$ gcloud services enable cloudbuild.googleapis.com
$ gcloud builds submit --config=cloudbuild.yaml
```

- Step 4: Replace image in [sample k8s deployment manifest](./sample-manifests/deployment.yaml).

```sh
$ kustomize edit set image gcr.io/PROJECT_ID/runner:latest=gcr.io/$PROJECT_ID/runner:latest
```

- Step 5: Generate kubeconfig and apply the manifests for Deployment and HorizontalPodAutoscaler.

```sh
$ gcloud container clusters get-credentials your-cluster-name --zone=your-cluster-zone
$ kustomize build . | kubectl apply -f -
```

- Step 6: Your runners should become active at https://github.com/owner/your-repo-name/settings/actions.
